# Algorithms

These are few of basic programs on Algorithms. Below are examples of problems I've solved 
1.How do we calculate which is nearest attraction when we stay at a particular hotel/place? which is the feasible means of transportation?using which transport do we reach there fast? though there are more accurate methods for distance calculation I've used cosines law to calculate it.
2.How do you choose a feasible place to stay based on your budget and the price&facilities offered by Hotel?
