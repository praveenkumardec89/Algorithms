# Algorithms

These are few of basic programs on Algorithms. Below are examples of problems I've solved 

1. How do we calculate which is nearest attraction when we stay at a particular hotel/place? which is the feasible means of transportation?using which transport do we reach there fast? though there are more accurate methods for distance calculation I've used cosines law to calculate it.

2. How do you choose a feasible place to stay based on your budget and the price&facilities offered by Hotel?

3. Based on the Feedback provided by the users ,, how do you excract the facilities/ problems of a particular Place?

4. You will get the list of cities a user is interested to visit, also a list of hotels within each city, each hotel has a price and a score which, and of course we would have the amount of euros that the user is ready to spend.You are required to find the highest total score of the hotels that the user can book within his budget.
